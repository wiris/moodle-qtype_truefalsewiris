Feature: True/False (WIRIS) answer input option
    In order to trust the True/False (WIRIS) answer input
    As a student
    I want the True and False radio options to be selectable and graded in an attempt

    # A True/False (WIRIS) question presents a single answer input: a pair of True /
    # False radio buttons (the WIRIS layer wraps the core truefalse renderer, which
    # uses real labels, so the options are clicked with the "True" / "False" radio
    # selector). The right answer is graded locally from the fixed correctanswer
    # (the helper templates leave wirisoverrideanswer empty so no random Wiris
    # variable is involved), so both a correct and an incorrect selection are
    # exercised end to end. Questions are built from the qtype_truefalsewiris test
    # helper templates (fixedtrue / fixedfalse).

    Background:
        Given the "wiris" filter is "on"
        And the "wiris" filter has maximum priority
        And the following "users" exist:
            | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
            | teacher1 | Teacher   | One      | teacher1@example.com |
            | student1 | Student   | One      | student1@example.com |
